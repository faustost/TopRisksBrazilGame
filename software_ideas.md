# Software Ideas Based on Eurasia Group Top Risks 2026

## Source Material
- **Document:** Eurasia Group Top Risks 2026 Report
- **Authors:** Ian Bremmer (President), Cliff Kupchan (Chairman)
- **File:** pardot_download.pdf

## The 10 Top Risks
1. US political revolution
2. Overpowered (China's electrotech dominance vs US)
3. The Donroe Doctrine (US asserting power in Western Hemisphere)
4. Europe under siege (political fragmentation in UK, France, Germany)
5. Russia's second front (hybrid warfare against NATO)
6. State capitalism with American characteristics
7. China's deflation trap
8. AI eats its users (extractive AI business models)
9. Zombie USMCA (North American trade limbo)
10. The water weapon (water as geopolitical leverage)

## Red Herrings (Overstated Risks)
- "Tariff Man" at large (peak tariff disruption already passed)
- Deglobalization (trade is restructuring, not disappearing)
- Spheres of influence (world too interconnected to carve up)
- Sell America (US remains most investable major economy)
